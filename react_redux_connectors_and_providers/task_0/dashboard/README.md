# React Redux Connectors and Providers

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Redux Connectors and How to Use Them

Redux connectors are a bridge between your React components and the Redux store. They allow you to connect components to the Redux store, enabling them to access and update the application state.

### 2. Different Functions for Connectors

In Redux, there are two primary functions you'll use when creating connectors:

-   `mapStateToProps`: This function maps a portion of the Redux state to props in your component, making that part of the state available for your component to use.
-   `mapDispatchToProps`: This function maps action creators to props, enabling your component to dispatch actions to modify the state.

### 3. Mapping an Action Creator to a Component using a Connector

You'll learn how to use connectors to map action creators to your components. This connection allows your components to dispatch actions easily, triggering state updates.

### 4. Mapping an Async Action Creator with Redux Thunk

Asynchronous actions are crucial in web development. Redux Thunk is a middleware that enables you to dispatch asynchronous actions in Redux. You'll learn how to use Redux Thunk to map async action creators to your components.

### 5. Redux Providers and Setting up Your App's Store

The Redux Provider is a critical component for integrating Redux with your React application. You'll understand how to set up the Redux store and provide it to your app using the `<Provider>` component.

### 6. Improving Connector Performance with Reselect

Reselect is a library that helps optimize the performance of your connectors by memoizing the results of mapStateToProps. You'll learn how to use Reselect to create memoized selectors for efficient data retrieval from the state.

### 7. Using Redux Dev Tools for Debugging

Redux Dev Tools is a powerful browser extension that aids in debugging your Redux application. You'll explore how to use these tools to inspect and manipulate the state of your application during development.

## Getting Started

To start your journey, make sure you have a basic understanding of React and JavaScript. Here are some steps to guide you:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Begin by creating a React application using Create React App or your preferred setup. Install Redux and Redux Thunk as dependencies:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk`
    
2.  **Create Your Redux Store**: Set up your Redux store by defining reducers and creating the store. Don't forget to wrap your app with the `<Provider>` component to provide access to the store.
    
3.  **Connect Components**: Use `connect` from `react-redux` to create connectors for your components. Implement `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` as needed.
    
4.  **Async Actions with Redux Thunk**: Learn how to create asynchronous action creators using Redux Thunk. This will enable you to fetch data from APIs or perform other asynchronous tasks.
    
5.  **Optimize with Reselect**: Experiment with Reselect to optimize your connectors, especially when working with large or frequently changing data.
    
6.  **Debug with Redux Dev Tools**: Install the Redux Dev Tools extension in your browser. It will help you track actions, inspect the state, and rewind to previous states for debugging.
