# React Class Components Project

This project is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of React Class Components. The main learning objectives of this project are:

## Learning Objectives

1. **When to use a Class or a function to create a component**: Understanding the difference between class components and functional components, and when to use each, is crucial in React development.

2. **The lifecycle of a Class component**: This project will help you understand the different lifecycle methods in a class component, such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

3. **How to test a component**: You will learn how to write unit tests for your components to ensure they are working as expected.

4. **How to utilize a Jest spy to verify that a function is being called correctly**: Jest spies are an important tool for testing the behavior of functions in your components.

5. **What an HOC (Higher-Order Component) is and how to use it**: Higher-Order Components are a way to reuse component logic, and this project will guide you on how to create and use them.

6. **How to optimize performance and control which components to render**: Performance optimization is key in large React applications. This project will teach you techniques such as using `shouldComponentUpdate` and `React.memo` to control when your components re-render.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

Happy coding!
