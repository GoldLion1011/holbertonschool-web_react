# React Redux action creator+normalizr

## Learning Objectives

In this project, I worked with the following key concepts and tools:

1. **Normalizr's Purpose and How to Use It**
   - Understand the purpose of Normalizr in managing and normalizing nested JSON data.
   - Learn how to use Normalizr to transform complex nested JSON structures into a more structured format.

2. **Schemas and Normalization of Nested JSON**
   - Explore the concept of schemas in Normalizr.
   - Learn how to define schemas for your data and use them to normalize nested JSON.

3. **Core Concepts of Redux**
   - Get acquainted with the fundamental concepts of Redux, including actions, reducers, and the Redux store.
   - Understand the principles behind Redux's unidirectional data flow.

4. **Redux Actions**
   - Learn about Redux actions, which are plain JavaScript objects used to describe changes to the state.
   - Discover how actions are dispatched to initiate state updates.

5. **Redux Action Creators**
   - Explore the role of action creators in Redux.
   - Understand how action creators simplify the process of creating and dispatching actions.

6. **Async Actions in Redux**
   - Dive into asynchronous operations in Redux, such as making API requests.
   - Learn how to handle async actions using middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.

7. **How to Write Tests for Redux**
   - Gain practical experience in writing unit tests for Redux components, including action creators, reducers, and selectors.
   - Explore testing libraries and tools commonly used in Redux testing.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will build a simple application that utilizes Redux for state management and Normalizr for handling nested JSON data. The application will involve fetching and displaying data from an API, and you will implement Redux actions to manage this data. Additionally, you will write tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your Redux components.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project Repository**
   - Clone the project repository from the provided GitHub URL.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Use a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` to install the project dependencies. Run the following command in your project directory:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
     or
     ```
     yarn install
     ```

3. **Project Structure**
   - Familiarize yourself with the project structure. You will find directories for components, actions, reducers, tests, and more.

4. **Learning Resources**
   - Utilize the provided learning resources, including documentation on Normalizr, Redux, and testing tools like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Usage

To effectively learn and practice the topics covered in this project, consider the following steps:

1. **Normalizr**
   - Start by examining the sample JSON data in your project. Identify nested structures that could benefit from normalization.
   - Explore Normalizr's documentation to understand how to define schemas and use them to normalize the data.

2. **Redux Basics**
   - Begin with the core concepts of Redux. Study how actions, reducers, and the store interact to manage application state.
   - Implement basic Redux actions to perform simple state changes.

3. **Redux Action Creators**
   - Create action creators to encapsulate the logic for dispatching actions. Practice dispatching actions with different payloads.

4. **Async Actions**
   - Extend your Redux knowledge to handle async operations. Use middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga to manage async actions.
   - Implement async actions for fetching data from an API and updating the Redux store.

5. **Testing**
   - Study the testing documentation and examples provided.
   - Write tests for your Redux components, ensuring proper coverage of actions, reducers, and any other relevant parts of your application.

## Conclusion

This school project offers an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Normalizr, Redux, and testing in the context of a real-world application. As you progress through the project, you will develop a deeper understanding of data normalization, state management with Redux, and the importance of writing tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

Good luck, and happy learning!
