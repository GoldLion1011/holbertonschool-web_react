Introduction

Welcome to the React and Redux project! In this project, you will explore the fundamental concepts of React and Redux, two powerful JavaScript libraries for building web applications. The primary learning objectives of this project are to understand the following key concepts:

Reducers and Their Purpose
A reducer is a core concept in Redux. It is a pure function responsible for specifying how the application's state changes in response to dispatched actions. Reducers take the current state and an action as input and return a new state. The purpose of a reducer is to manage and update the application's state in a predictable and controlled manner.
The Importance of Reducer Purity
Reducers should remain as pure as possible. A pure function is one that produces the same output for the same input, without causing any side effects. This purity ensures predictability and ease of testing. Mutations or side effects within reducers should be avoided to maintain a clean and understandable codebase.
Avoiding Mutations in Reducers
Mutations, or direct modifications to the state, should never occur within a reducer. Instead, a new state object should be created by copying the existing state and applying changes to the copied object. This immutability ensures that the application state remains consistent and allows for easier debugging and tracking of changes.
Using Immutable Data Structures
Immutable data structures, such as Immutable.js or JavaScript's spread operator, are often used to facilitate the creation of new state objects without mutating the existing state. You will explore how to work with these structures to maintain the purity of your reducers.
Utilizing Normalizr for Data Normalization
Normalizr is a library that helps in organizing complex, nested data structures by normalizing them into a flat structure with unique identifiers. This simplifies data manipulation and retrieval, especially when dealing with relational data. You will learn how to integrate Normalizr into your application to manage data effectively.
Selectors: Their Purpose and When to Use Them
Selectors are functions that encapsulate the logic for extracting specific pieces of data from the application state. They play a crucial role in decoupling the state structure from the components, making it easier to adapt to changes in the state shape. You will learn when and how to use selectors to access and present data within your components efficiently.
Project Structure

This project consists of various modules and exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of the concepts mentioned above. Each module will provide hands-on experience with React and Redux, gradually building your skills and confidence in web development.

Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for writing and editing your code.
To run the project and complete the exercises, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd react-redux-project
Install the project dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.
Conclusion

This project will provide you with valuable hands-on experience and insights into building web applications using React and Redux. By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of reducers, their purity, data normalization with Normalizr, and the use of selectors. These skills will be essential as you continue your journey into web development with React and Redux.
